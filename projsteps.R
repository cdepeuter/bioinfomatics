#get gene omnibus

#do regular gene expression analysis (which ones is impt)

#get distance matrix

#do mapper, what clusters do the important genes end up in
 
#if multiple, whys that

#regardless of multiple or single, what genes were not significantly expressed
# but are in the same cluster as the significantly expressed ones


#look at the pathways of the important genes
#can we make any insight from those

#use TOPAseq for some topological analysis of the pathways
